# google-maps-list_backup

A way to copy all your marked points from any list in  google maps to a JSON file.

ItÂ´s a very basic with mouse control way to simulate a human copy and past all its own saved places. 
There are thoughts of integrating webscraping, but not yet integrated

I only do this project, to save my places with the labels, which is not possible from the google side.


If there is a better way or you have something to contribute, than feel free. 

Last but not least, if this violating any rules of google, than i have no problem to delete this project.
